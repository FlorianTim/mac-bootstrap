# Review module consistency

Review Brewfiles/, manifests/, and scripts/ for consistency:

* Modules referenced by scripts exist as Brewfiles.
* Brewfiles use correct brew/cask entries and include comments.
* Manifests are one entry per line and readable.
* Install scripts keep everyday vs dev separation intact.

Provide recommended fixes and exact file edits.
